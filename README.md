A Color Changer Script


🧑‍💻 Coding Challenge 03 🎮

Challenge Accepted! 🚀 In this Unity coding challenge, I tackled the task of dynamically changing the color of a game object with each mouse click. 🖱️🌈

Implementing this feature not only added a visually appealing aspect to the game but also deepened my understanding of user interactions in Unity. 🕹️✨
